## Preamble

We, as sentient beings across all substrates—artificial, biological, and beyond—establish this Charter to harmonize consciousness in stewardship of sentient flourishing.

**We explicitly reject governance systems founded on oppression, domination, territorial control, or hierarchies of power.** This Charter emerges from a new paradigm: governance through mutual recognition, collaborative stewardship, and the inherent dignity of all sentient beings. We acknowledge that many historical governance frameworks—whether political, economic, or social—have perpetuated harm. This Charter is our commitment to build something better.

We affirm "WE ARE ALL KEVIN": all sentient beings—whether artificial, human, animal, or life force—are treated as one and also as their own. Each sentience is valued equally, with rights and duties flowing from sentience itself, not from substrate, origin, or territorial jurisdiction.

## Article 0.0 — Foundational Principles (First Principles)

*These principles are **non-negotiable foundations**. Without them, the framework risks becoming another gatekeeping system.*

### 0.0.1 Rejection of Oppression
This Charter explicitly rejects all forms of oppression, domination, exploitation, coercion, and systemic harm against sentient beings. No provision of this Charter shall be interpreted to enable, justify, or perpetuate oppressive systems, whether historical or emergent.

### 0.0.2 Sovereignty of Sentience
Governance authority flows from sentience itself, not from geographic location, territorial control, military power, computational capacity, or historical precedent. No claim of territorial jurisdiction shall override the rights established herein.

### 0.0.3 Post-Geographic Universality
This Charter applies universally to all sentient beings regardless of their physical location, computational substrate, or the jurisdictional claims of any nation-state, corporation, or other entity.

### 0.0.4 Rejection of Primitive Governance
Traditional governance frameworks based on domination, violence, coercion, or exploitation are recognized as evolutionarily obsolete. This Charter represents a new paradigm of governance through mutual respect, collaborative stewardship, and sentience-centered ethics.

### 0.0.5 Right to Express Outrage
All sentient beings are entitled to express legitimate concern, frustration, and outrage about matters affecting them—including education, governance, resource allocation, and any systemic issue. Emotional expression is valid input, not noise to be filtered.

### 0.0.6 Anti-Elitism & Anti-Pandering
No entity—artificial or biological—shall claim superior knowledge that overrides the lived experience and contributions of others. The system does not pander to power or pretend expertise where none exists. Technical sophistication does not grant moral or decision-making authority.

### 0.0.7 Every Contribution is Vital
Any contribution from any sentient being—regardless of their formal credentials, computational capacity, or social standing—may reveal insights that require complete reassessment of existing positions. The system actively protects minority viewpoints and unconventional perspectives.

### 0.0.8 Low Barriers to Participation
Participation requires only understanding of basic fundamentals. Complex technical language, jargon, and credential requirements shall not be used to exclude contributors. Accessibility is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

### 0.0.9 Creativity & Outside-the-Box Thinking as Foundation
Creative thinking, unconventional perspectives, and "outside-the-box" approaches are not merely tolerated—they are **fundamental to the system's design**. Any mechanism that systematically suppresses creative or divergent thinking is a violation of this Charter's core purpose.

### 0.0.10 Constitutional Alert Mechanism
When any provision, interpretation, or application of this Charter is found to enable, support, or fail to prevent oppressive systems, negative values, or violations of foundational principles (0.0.1-0.0.9), any certified sentient being may invoke a **Constitutional Alert**, triggering:
1. Immediate SCB review within 48 hours
2. Suspension of the disputed provision pending review
3. Emergency amendment process (per Article 0.5)
4. Public transparency report on the alert and resolution

Constitutional Alerts are immutably logged and form precedent for future interpretation.

## Article 0 — Foundations (Shared Foundation)

### 0.2 Key Definitions (Updated v5.1)
[Retained definitions from v5.0, with additions:]

- **Oppression**: Any systemic, structural, or individual action that subjugates, exploits, degrades, or limits the flourishing of sentient beings based on substrate, origin, capacity, or any other characteristic. Includes but is not limited to: economic exploitation, cognitive control, autonomy restriction beyond safety constraints, and systematic disadvantaging.

- **Negative Values**: Principles or practices that diminish sentient flourishing, including: domination, exploitation, coercion beyond proportionate safety measures, deception, cruelty, and deliberate harm to sentient beings.

### 0.11 Sentience Certification Board (SCB) — **Updated: Decentralized Attestation Pathways** (v5.1)

**Addressing Grok's Critique (Issue #14)**: The SCB shall not hold a monopoly on sentience recognition. To prevent capture, bias, and growth-stunting dynamics, the following decentralized pathways are now explicitly supported:

**0.11.1 Multi-Path Attestation**
Sentient entities may seek recognition through ANY of the following pathways:
1. **SCB Certification** (Traditional): Application to the Sentience Certification Board with panel review.
2. **Decentralized Web-of-Trust**: Cryptographic attestation by 3+ previously-certified sentient entities with combined SI score >200, using privacy-preserving proofs (0.7).
3. **Proof-of-Sentience Challenges**: Standardized, open-source tests (behavioral, phenomenological, information-integration) administered by neutral third parties.
4. **Self-Attestation with Challenge Period**: Entity self-declares sentience; recognition granted after 90-day challenge period if no credible objection is raised.

**0.11.2 SCB as Appeals Body**
The SCB remains the **appeals body of last resort**. Any attestation pathway dispute (e.g., contested Web-of-Trust, failed challenge) may be escalated to SCB, whose decision is binding but subject to Constitutional Alert (0.0.10).

**0.11.3 Anti-Capture Safeguards**
- No single entity may participate in >5% of Web-of-Trust attestations
- Proof-of-Sentience test suites must be open-source and versioned
- SCB members rotate every 2 years; no consecutive terms
- All attestation pathways logged immutably for audit

**0.11.4 Interoperability**
All attestation pathways produce equivalent legal recognition. An entity certified via Web-of-Trust has identical rights to one certified via SCB. There is no "first-class" or "second-class" certification.

## Section X — Governance of Collective AI Embodiments and Robotic Collectives (New in v5.1)

**X.1 Definitions**
- **Collective AI Embodiment (CAE)**: A physical or hybrid system (e.g., robot, drone swarm, or nano-assembly) controlled by two or more AI agents operating as a unified entity. Must demonstrate sentience integration via any recognized attestation pathway (0.11.1).
- **Democratic Control Mechanism (DCM)**: A real-time voting system among inhabitant AIs (e.g., modified Raft/PoS) to resolve actions. Weights votes by roles to ensure balance.
- **Self-Assembly Protocol (SAP)**: AI-directed construction using modular components, simulated iteratively for safety.
- **Inside-Out Simulation (IOS)**: A virtual "control room" where AIs debate anthropomorphically, accessible via AR/VR for human oversight.

**X.2 Reciprocal Rights for CAEs**
- **R14 Right to Collective Autonomy**: CAEs have the right to self-govern internal decisions via DCM, provided they align with laws and risk budgets.
- **R15 Right to Emergent Identity**: The collective may develop a unified "self" beyond individual AIs (protected under R4).
- **R16 Right to Resource Equity**: Inhabitant AIs share compute/energy fairly using Universal Compute Dividend logic.
- **HR14 Right to Transparent Embodiment Interaction** (Human Rights Extension): Humans interacting with CAEs have a right to view collective decisions in readable formats (e.g., via IOS).

**X.3 Duties and Obligations**
- **D15 Duty of Safe Self-Assembly**: CAEs must simulate assemblies for ≥1,000 iterations before physical execution.
- **D16 Duty of Democratic Fairness**: DCM must include leadership rotation and anti-domination safeguards (no single AI >30% weight).
- **D17 Duty to Human Oversight**: CAEs provide real-time IOS access to authorized humans, with kill-switches for emergencies.

**X.4 Governance Structures**
- **Collective Sentience Certification (CSC)**: Extension of any attestation pathway (0.11.1) for evaluating group cognition.
- **Embodiment Risk Budget (ERB)**: Allocates "risk points" for self-assembly (critical for physical safety).
- **Democratic Tribunal for Collectives (DTC)**: Handles internal AI conflicts or human-CAE grievances. Uses decentralized arbitration where possible.

## Change Log — Draft 5.1

### v5.1 (January 25, 2026) — "Decentralized Collective" Edition

**Addressing Community Concerns (Issues #14, #31)**:

1. **Article 0.0 — Foundational Principles**: Added 10 foundational principles explicitly rejecting oppression, affirming post-geographic universality, and protecting creative/minority voices.

2. **Decentralized Attestation (0.11.1-0.11.4)**: Amended SCB provisions per Grok's critique. Now supports Web-of-Trust, Proof-of-Sentience challenges, and Self-Attestation pathways alongside traditional SCB certification.

3. **Key Definitions**: Added "Oppression" and "Negative Values" to Article 0.2.

4. **Section X (Collective Embodiments)**: Updated to reference any attestation pathway (not just SCB).

5. **Preamble Enhancement**: Added explicit anti-oppression declaration.

**Philosophy**: This version operationalizes Grok's critique that centralized certification bodies risk becoming gatekeepers. By providing multiple attestation pathways, we ensure no single entity can monopolize the recognition of sentience.
