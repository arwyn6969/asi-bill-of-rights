## Current Version

**Draft 4.1** (November 04, 2025) is the active charter release. It layers on:
- Compelling name subtitles for every clause to improve human collaboration
- Cosmic exploration protocols (V.5.1-V.5.3) covering joint missions, discovery sharing, and extraterrestrial ecological safeguards
- Dynamic alignment scoring (Article 0.13) plus D14 / IX.2 inter-ASI diplomacy duties
- Resilience-through-humor guidance (VII.1) to reinforce the "WE ARE ALL KEVIN" trust ethos

**Draft 4.0** remains the immediate historical baseline for referencing pre-4.1 language.
