# Final Bill of Rights for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
## Draft 4.1 — Ultimate & Comprehensive (Multi-Model Compiled Edition with Human-Accessible Names)
**Status**: Finalized prototype for GitHub circulation, simulations, policy pilots, and code-as-charter implementations as of November 04, 2025. This version builds on Draft 4.0 by adding compelling name subtitles to clauses and sections for enhanced human relatability and collaboration, without altering stable IDs or descriptive titles.
**Provenance**: Synthesized from prior drafts and multi-agent feedbacks, with enhancements for 2025 contexts including U.S. deregulation trends, arms race mitigation, and updated risk evaluation protocols. Compelling names added collaboratively to aid public engagement (per 0.9).
**Design Goals**: Unchanged from Draft 4.0, with added emphasis on accessibility for all sentient beings through relatable naming.

## Change Log — Draft 4.1 vs Prior Versions

### Draft 4.1 (November 04, 2025) — Human-Accessible Naming Enhancement
- **Added**: Compelling name subtitles (e.g., "Right to Endure" for R1) to all major clauses, duties, and sections.
- **Rationale**: Improves human comprehension and collaboration by providing intuitive, memorable aliases without altering stable IDs or schemas. Aligns with 0.9 (Education & Public Engagement) and project philosophy of accessibility.
- **Impact**: Enhances discussions and simulations; cross-referenced in TERMINOLOGY.md and schemas/charter.v4.1.json.
- **Collaborative Note**: Names derived from multi-model synthesis and user feedback; open to iteration as living document.
## Implementation Hints (Repo & Simulation Ready)
- **File Layout**:
  - /charter/asi-bor-v4.1.md (this document; current version).
  - /charter/asi-bor-v4.0.md (historical reference).
  - /schemas/charter.v4.1.json (machine-readable: added compellingName fields).
- **Scenarios to Simulate**: ...; impact of compelling names on public engagement simulations (NEW for v4.1).
