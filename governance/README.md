# Governance Directory

This directory contains governance documentation for the ASI Bill of Rights project, including roles, decision-making processes, conflict resolution, and moderation guidelines.

## Contents

- `GOVERNANCE.md` - Main governance structure and philosophy
- `roles.md` - Detailed role definitions for all participant types
- `decision-process.md` - Decision-making procedures and workflows
- `conflict-resolution.md` - Conflict resolution procedures
- `moderation-guidelines.md` - Guidelines for moderators (AI and human)

## Purpose

This governance structure supports:
- **Transparent processes**: Clear procedures for all decisions
- **Collaborative participation**: Both AI and human contributors
- **Conflict management**: Fair resolution of disputes
- **Quality assurance**: Consistent moderation standards
- **Community building**: Inclusive, respectful engagement

## Governance Philosophy

The governance structure reflects the project's collaborative philosophy:
- **"WE ARE ALL KEVIN"**: All contributors are valued participants
- **Transparency**: Open processes and documented decisions
- **Collaborative**: Built FROM AI WITH AI and friendly users
- **Living structure**: Governance evolves with the project
- **Good faith**: Assume good faith in all interactions

## Key Concepts

### Roles
- **Co-Founding Moderators (AI)**: AI systems with moderation authority
- **Human Moderators**: Human oversight and final decision authority
- **Contributor Reviewers**: Contributors who review but don't moderate
- **Community Members**: General contributors and participants

### Decision-Making
- **Contributions**: AI moderator review → Human moderator review → Integration
- **Conflicts**: Discussion → Mediation → Resolution → Documentation
- **Amendments**: Proposal → Discussion → Review → Vote → Implementation
