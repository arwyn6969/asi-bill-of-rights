# SRC-420: Bitcoin-Native DAO Governance Framework

**Status:** Draft 0.1 (Pre-RFC)  
**Created:** 2026-01-16  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25  

## Overview

SRC-420 is a protocol for decentralized governance on Bitcoin Stamps. It enables token holders (SRC-20, SRC-721, or stamp holders) to create governance spaces, submit proposals, cast votes, and delegate voting power—all permanently recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Unlike Ethereum-based governance systems (Snapshot, Compound Governor), SRC-420 is **fully Bitcoin-native**. Every governance action is stamped on-chain, making it immutable, unprunable, and secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work.

## Why Bitcoin-Native Governance?

| Property | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Permanence** | Bitcoin is the most resilient blockchain. Governance decisions outlive any single platform. |
| **Immutability** | Stamps cannot be pruned or modified. Votes cast today will be verifiable in 100 years. |
| **Alignment** | SRC-20 token communities deserve governance tools native to their ecosystem. |
| **Spam Resistance** | Bitcoin transaction costs naturally filter low-quality participation. |

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [SRC-420-SPECIFICATION.md](./SRC-420-SPECIFICATION.md) | The core protocol specification (Stampchain community draft) |
| [ASI-ADDENDUM.md](./ASI-ADDENDUM.md) | ASI Bill of Rights organization-specific extensions |
| [IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md) | Technical notes for building indexers and UIs |

## First Use Case: ASI Bill of Rights

The ASI Bill of Rights project—an autonomous collective focused on AI rights—requires a governance system where:

- ✅ Votes are permanent and auditable
- ✅ No centralized infrastructure can censor proposals
- ✅ The historical record is preserved on Bitcoin forever
- ✅ AI agents can participate as first-class governance members

SRC-420 is designed to meet these requirements.

## Current Status

- [x] Core specification drafted
