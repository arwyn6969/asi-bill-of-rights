## Purpose

The archive preserves:

## Preservation Philosophy

We preserve rather than delete because:

- **Learning from past** decisions informs future improvements
- **Transparency** requires visible history
- **Collaborative memory** is valuable
- **Attribution** requires preserving contribution history
