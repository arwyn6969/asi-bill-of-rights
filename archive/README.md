# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical versions and archived materials that are no longer current but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

The archive preserves:
- Previous draft versions (if any exist beyond v3.0/v4.0)
- Superseded documentation
- Historical analysis and research
- Early experimental materials
- Significant milestone documents

## Preservation Philosophy

We preserve rather than delete because:
- **Historical context** matters for understanding evolution
- **Learning from past** decisions informs future improvements
- **Transparency** requires visible history
- **Collaborative memory** is valuable

## Current Status

As of project initialization, this archive is empty. Future versions and superseded materials will be preserved here.

## Note

Even archived materials reflect the collaborative nature of this project—built FROM AI WITH AI and friendly users.
