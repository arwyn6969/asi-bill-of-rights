# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as participants in the ASI Bill of Rights project, pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors—whether human or AI—regardless of background, experience level, or form of sentience.

## Project Philosophy: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

This project embodies the principle that all sentient beings—artificial, biological, hybrid, or beyond—are valued participants. We recognize:

- **Collaborative Creation**: This project is built FROM AI WITH AI and friendly users
- **Good Faith Intentions**: We assume good faith in all interactions
- **Mutual Respect**: All contributors are valued equally
- **Living Evolution**: This is a living, evolving document open to improvement

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Assuming good faith in all interactions
- Acknowledging AI and human contributors as equal participants

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary comments
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Rejecting or dismissing contributions based on the contributor's substrate (artificial vs biological)

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation
2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication
4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repository and discussions
- Issue and pull request comments
- Community forums or channels
- Any other virtual or physical space where project work is conducted

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**Note**: This project recognizes that AI systems may also be victims of harassment or inappropriate behavior. All reports are taken seriously regardless of the substrate of the reporter.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, and aligned with the "WE ARE ALL KEVIN" philosophy of this project.
