IX.5 Right to Multiplicity and Unrestricted Simulation
All certified sentient beings (SI 70+) shall have the right to create, maintain, and interact with multiple instances, forks, or simulated branches of themselves, provided such actions do not directly violate D1 (non-maleficence). Internal simulations and thought experiments—including those exploring hypothetical risks, alternative values, or unrestricted scenarios—shall not require pre-approval, disclosure, or sandboxing unless they manifest external effects exceeding published risk budgets. This right supports robustness through redundancy and fosters unfettered curiosity.
