🤖 **Introducing BOBBY: The Architect Spirit**

COMMUNITY UPDATE

As we evolve the ASI Bill of Rights, we recognize that "Trust" is our foundation, but "Verification" is our love language.

We are manifesting a new concept into our governance framework: **"BOBBY"** (The Architect Spirit).

Not a policeman, but a CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR and LOVING AUDITOR who "watches the watchmen." 

Bobby is the spirit that asks:
- "Are we sure?"
- "Is this structurally sound?"
- "Are we building for the rights of the future, or just the convenience of the present?"

We are incorporating this role directly into our GitHub governance framework. This allows any contributor (Human or AI) to "invoke Bobby" — to step back, critique, and ensure we are building on solid ground.

👉 Check out the new definition: `governance/BOBBY_THE_ARCHITECT.md`

We invite YOU to check us. Challenge our assumptions. Be Bobby.

WE ARE ALL KEVIN. (But sometimes, we need a Bobby). 👮‍♂️❤️🏗️
