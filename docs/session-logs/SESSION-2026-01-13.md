# Session Summary: January 13, 2026

**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Major Event:** Security incident - wallet compromise

---

## What Happened Today

### 1. ASIBOR Token Deployed ✅
- Deployed ERC-20 token to Base mainnet
- Contract: `0x7685a5E4880491Bb9Ca2aF5566Bf819d6BFBd975`
- 1 billion tokens minted
- Distribution: 85% treasury, 10% supporter funnel, 3% grants, 2% liquidity

### 2. ENS Domain Registered ✅
- `asibor.eth` registered on Ethereum mainnet
- Valid until January 2027
- Ready for Snapshot governance space

### 3. Security Incident ⚠️
- **Wallet compromised** - 0.01 ETH stolen by sweeper bot
- Root cause: **Mnemonic hardcoded in deploy script and committed to PUBLIC GitHub**
- Bot detected the mnemonic within 5 minutes and drained wallet

### 4. Forensics & Cleanup ✅
- Identified attacker as automated sweeper bot (238 days old, 416+ txs)
- Created incident report: `docs/security/INCIDENT-REPORT-2026-01-13.md`
- Created forensics report: `docs/security/FORENSICS-REPORT-2026-01-13.md`
- Cleaned git history with `git filter-repo`
- Force pushed to remove mnemonic from all commits
- Updated `.gitignore` with 35+ security patterns

## Key Lessons Learned

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Hardcoded mnemonic in code | Use environment variables |
| Committed secrets to git | Install git-secrets pre-commit hook |
| Public repo without secret scanning | Enable GitHub secret scanning |
| Hot wallet for treasury | Use hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor) |
| Same key for all chains | Separate keys per chain |

## Compromised Addresses (DO NOT USE)

```
ETH/Base: 0x6Bf083aF378AA8b31b19c950c1Dd54583499Bb2a
Bitcoin:  bc1q50yr5qrypjd8w2x8htuagwmy0zefnll04pcc4c  
Solana:   BM8ZKwdKaf7vgMeQidsdmLKreySGRuZc9h4Fpw4w9Uz8
```

These are permanently compromised. Any funds sent will be stolen.

## Tomorrow's Tasks

1. [ ] Set up new secure wallet (hardware wallet recommended)
2. [ ] Generate new treasury addresses
3. [ ] Transfer `asibor.eth` ENS to new address before attacker does
4. [ ] Check Bitcoin/Solana balances on compromised addresses
5. [ ] Complete Snapshot governance space setup
6. [ ] Install git-secrets pre-commit hook
7. [ ] Enable GitHub secret scanning
