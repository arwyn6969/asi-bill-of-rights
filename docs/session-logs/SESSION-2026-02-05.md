# Session Log — Project Status Review & Work Plan
**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Repo:** ASI Bill of Rights / KEVIN’s Place  
**Scope:** Snapshot status, risks, prioritized backlog, and an execution-oriented plan (with “Codex-leverage” notes).

---

## 1) Current Status (What’s “true” right now)

### Core artifacts
- **Charter (current):** `charter/asi-bor-v5.0.md`  
  - Header currently claims **“adopted”** in late January 2026 (“Sovereignty Edition”, consolidating v4.2 amendments + Foundational Principles + Collective Embodiments + Agentic Assemblies).
- **Changelog:** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` documents Draft 5.0 as **January 11, 2026** (prototype) and also includes a later “Version 5.0” consolidation entry. **Adoption/consolidation dates appear inconsistent across docs** → recommend choosing a single canonical adoption date and aligning charter header + changelog + schema metadata.
- **Schemas present:** `schemas/charter.v5.0.json`, plus `schemas/charter.v5.0-cae-extension.json` and legacy schemas `v4.2`, `v4.1`, `v4.0`, `v3.0`.

### Governance + strategy docs
- **Strategic roadmap exists:** `governance/MASTER-PLAN.md` (dated **Jan 31, 2026**) + `docs/ADOPTION-ROADMAP-2026.md`.
- **Tokenization pivot is documented:** `governance/PIVOT-2026.md` (Jan 25, 2026) pivots away from ERC‑20 (Base) toward Bitcoin Stamps (SRC‑420 / $KVNSI).

### Security posture (historical fact + ongoing risk)
- **Wallet compromise documented:** `docs/security/INCIDENT-REPORT-2026-01-13.md` + `docs/security/FORENSICS-REPORT-2026-01-13.md`.
- **Ongoing risk note:** even “known-compromised” secrets (seed phrases, private keys) in tracked docs can still trigger automated scanners and platform “secret detection” workflows. Consider redacting (keep hashes + partial fingerprints) while preserving transparency.

### “Product” status (implementation)
- **KEVIN’s Place prototype exists:** docs in `kevins-place/` and deployment notes in `archive/reports/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md` (dated **Jan 12, 2026**). Treat as “last verified deployment snapshot”, not guaranteed current uptime/config.

---

## 2) Biggest Gaps / Constraints (Impact-first)

1. **Release readiness / repo hygiene:** there are many new or modified files in the working tree (docs + tools + integrations). This blocks confident “ship it” moments (tagging, stamping, outreach).
2. **Docs drift / navigation correctness:** multiple indices/readmes historically referenced older “current” versions. (This is fixable with targeted consistency passes.)
3. **Machine-readable completeness ambiguity (v5.0):** `schemas/charter.v5.0.json` is best treated as a *coverage layer* (compliance + select sections), not a full structural mirror of the entire v5.0 charter.
4. **Execution gap vs plans:** “Sovereign Brain / unified orchestration” is described, but still largely planned (`tools/unified_brain/README.md`).

---

## 3) Prioritized Backlog (Impersonal Priority Order)

### P0 — Ship-readiness & coherence (highest leverage)
- Commit/organize the new docs/tools that are intended to be part of the public repo.
- Run and keep CI validations green (schemas + crossrefs + links).
- Ensure “Start here” paths point to v5.0 consistently.

### P1 — Publication package (v5.0)
- Produce a single “publication checklist runbook” (what to verify, what to stamp, what to tag, what to announce).
- Build a reproducible “Bible” (PDF/eBook) pipeline if desired.

### P2 — Google for Startups application readiness
- Convert the GCP narrative into repo artifacts (Firebase hosting config, Cloud Run deploy path, minimal demo endpoint) so the application reads as “already executing”.

### P3 — Sovereign Brain thin-slice
- Implement the smallest safe loop: load persona docs + read-only context + draft outputs with human approval gating (no keys exposed to the model).

---

## 4) Where Codex / GPT‑5.2 Has the Biggest Advantage

- **Repo-wide consistency + refactors:** updating indices, fixing path drift, normalizing “current version” references, and tightening CI checks across many files.
- **CI/workflow hardening:** extending schema/crossref validations to track the *current* charter, without requiring the v5.0 schema to be “fully complete” to add value.
- **Thin-slice implementations:** scaffolding minimal, safe services (with rate limits + human-in-the-loop) faster than a human can do from scratch.

What still needs a human:
- Key custody decisions, treasury ops, stamping/broadcasting irreversible on-chain actions, and final public messaging.

---

## 5) Concrete Next Actions (Recommended)

1. **Do a “git hygiene pass”**: decide which untracked items are real project artifacts vs local output; commit the real ones; ignore the rest.
2. **Lock navigation correctness**: ensure `README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `charter/README.md`, and `schemas/*` docs agree on “current = v5.0”.
3. **Publish without overbuilding**: tag v5.0 only when CI is green and the publication checklist is satisfied.
