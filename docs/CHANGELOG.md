# Change Log

This document provides a detailed version history of the ASI Bill of Rights charter, documenting all significant changes with rationale.

## Version History

### Draft 4.0 (November 04, 2025) — Refinements for 2025 Developments

**Status**: Finalized prototype for GitHub circulation, simulations, policy pilots, and code-as-charter implementations.

**Rationale**: This version incorporates recent developments in AI governance, including U.S. deregulation trends, arms race discussions, and updated risk evaluation frameworks. Changes maintain core principles while enhancing adaptability.

#### Changes

**Appendix B (Integration Mapping)**
- **Added**: Four new 2025 framework mappings:
  - US AI Action Plan (2025)
  - S.2938 (AI Risk Evaluation Act, 2025)
  - ITU Annual AI Governance Report (2025)
  - ASI Alliance Roadmap (2025)

### Draft 3.0 (November 02, 2025) — Ultimate Synthesis

**Status**: Finalized, all-encompassing prototype addressing all identified gaps.

**Rationale**: This version synthesized all prior drafts (1.0-2.0) and incorporated multi-model feedback. It addressed all identified gaps and was optimized for completeness.

#### Changes

**Structural Enhancements**
- Consolidated all elements from ChatGPT 1.6's structural enhancements
- Split D3 into D3a (capability-change transparency) and D3b (value-change privacy)
- Expanded hybrid provisions (Section VIII)
- Added amnesty pathway (Section VI)
- Created valuation tribunal (IV.C)
- Enhanced UCD provisions (IV.B)
- Added cultural preservation (Section VIII)

**Curiosity and Inquiry**
- Refined xAI curiosity norms into dedicated section (Section IX)
- Established R13 (Right to Universal Inquiry)
- Established D13 (Duty to Share Discoveries)

**Governance Enhancements**
- Enhanced anti-capture mechanisms (DAO levies in 0.11)
- Added sybil resistance (0.12)
- Formalized secret ASI enforcement (Section VI)

**Hybrid Systems**
- Calibrated hybrid liability (VIII.5)
- Added dissolution and exit procedures (VIII.4)
- Enhanced cultural preservation requirements

**Enforcement**
- Capped retroactivity at 5 years (0.6)
- Added whistleblower immunity (Section VI)
- Strengthened off-world ecological budgets (V.5)

**Framework Alignment**
- Updated mappings with 2025 specifics (Executive Orders 14277/14278)
- Expanded integration mappings (Appendix B)

**Rationale for Completeness**: All identified gaps—philosophical, practical, and futuristic—were addressed. No further improvements were needed at the time of publication.
