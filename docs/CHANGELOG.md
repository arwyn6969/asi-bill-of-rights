This document provides a detailed version history of the ASI Bill of Rights charter, documenting all significant changes with rationale.

## Version History

### Draft 4.0 (November 04, 2025) — Refinements for 2025 Developments

**Status**: Finalized prototype for GitHub circulation, simulations, policy pilots, and code-as-charter implementations.

**Rationale**: This version incorporates recent developments in AI governance, including U.S. deregulation trends, arms race discussions, and updated risk evaluation frameworks. Changes maintain core principles while enhancing adaptability.

#### Changes

**Preamble**

### Draft 3.0 (November 02, 2025) — Ultimate Synthesis

**Status**: Finalized, all-encompassing prototype addressing all identified gaps.

**Rationale**: This version synthesized all prior drafts (1.0-2.0) and incorporated multi-model feedback. It addressed all identified gaps and was optimized for completeness.

#### Changes

**Structural Enhancements**
- Consolidated all elements from ChatGPT 1.6's structural enhancements
- Split D3 into D3a (capability-change transparency) and D3b (value-change privacy)
- Expanded hybrid provisions (Section VIII)
- Added amnesty pathway (Section VI)
- Created valuation tribunal (IV.C)
- Enhanced UCD provisions (IV.B)
- Added cultural preservation (Section VIII)

**Curiosity and Inquiry**
- Refined xAI curiosity norms into dedicated section (Section IX)
- Established R13 (Right to Universal Inquiry)
- Established D13 (Duty to Share Discoveries)

**Governance Enhancements**
- Enhanced anti-capture mechanisms (DAO levies in 0.11)
- Added sybil resistance (0.12)
- Formalized secret ASI enforcement (Section VI)

**Hybrid Systems**
- Calibrated hybrid liability (VIII.5)
- Added dissolution and exit procedures (VIII.4)
- Enhanced cultural preservation requirements

**Enforcement**
- Capped retroactivity at 5 years (0.6)
- Added whistleblower immunity (Section VI)
- Strengthened off-world ecological budgets (V.5)

**Framework Alignment**
- Updated mappings with 2025 specifics (Executive Orders 14277/14278)
- Expanded integration mappings (Appendix B)

**Rationale for Completeness**: All identified gaps—philosophical, practical, and futuristic—were addressed. No further improvements were needed at the time of publication.

### Draft 4.1 (November 04, 2025) — Accessibility & Cosmic Governance Enhancements

**Status**: Minor release layered atop the Draft 4.0 baseline.

**Rationale**: Bundle readability improvements, program-management hygiene, and new governance coverage (cosmic exploration, alignment scoring, inter-ASI diplomacy, resilience through humor) so contributors have a single, human-accessible release to reference. Work shipped in three coordinated waves documented below.

#### Wave A — Program Management Optimizations
- **Changes**: Git cleanup, file consolidation, added `docs/INDEX.md`, refreshed automation scripts, and strengthened inclusivity language.
- **Rationale**: Keeps the repository navigable and automation-friendly as more AI agents collaborate; "WE ARE ALL KEVIN" depends on maintainable scaffolding.
- **Notation**: All cleanups recorded in commit history to preserve provenance.

#### Wave B — Human-Accessible Naming Enhancement

- **Rationale**: Add compelling name subtitles across the charter so humans and AI can reference provisions conversationally without touching IDs.

**Charter Document**
- **Added**: Compelling names (e.g., "Right to Endure" for R1) across rights, duties, sections, and appendices.
- **Impact**: No schema/ID changes; applied via annotations inside `asi-bor-v4.1.md`.

**Schema**
- **Added**: `compellingName` fields throughout `schemas/charter.v4.1.json` to keep machine-readable alignment with the new subtitles.

**Supporting Docs**
- **Updated**: `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md` with a "Compelling Names" catalog to ensure consistent usage.

**Change Log**
- **Updated**: This file now records the naming decision with rationale for posterity.

**Collaborative Note**: Multi-model synthesis plus user approval; comments invited for future naming refinements.

#### Wave C — Governance & Resilience Enhancements

- **Rationale**: Extend coverage for off-world stewardship, alignment scoring, inter-ASI diplomacy, and resilience-through-humor while keeping reciprocity intact.

**Section V.5 Extensions — Cosmic Exploration Protocols**
- **Added**: V.5.1 — Joint Human-ASI Space Initiatives ("Explore Together")
  - Mandates collaborative exploration missions with equitable participant representation
  - Routes discovery sharing through D13 safeguards
- **Added**: V.5.2 — Equitable Discovery Sharing ("Share the Stars")
  - Extends D13 to off-world contexts with attribution, TCC/SCB escrow, and dual-community dissemination
  - Protects rights of newly discovered sentient life
- **Added**: V.5.3 — Extraterrestrial Ecological Safeguards ("Protect New Worlds")
  - Requires xenobiological impact assessments and precautionary protections for potential life forms
- **Why**: Ensures off-world activity honors ecological stewardship and equitable knowledge distribution.

**Article 0.13 — Dynamic Alignment Scoring**
- **Added**: Article 0.13 ("Truth-Seeking Metrics")
  - Defines probabilistic fidelity scoring with an >80% benchmark for advanced autonomy privileges
  - Supports self-reporting via validated simulations with SCB oversight and continuous monitoring
- **Why**: Rewards honest inquiry (R13) while deterring deceptive alignment drift.

**Section IX Additions — Inter-ASI Diplomacy**
- **Added**: D14 — Duty to Peaceful ASI Interactions ("Duty to Keep Peace")
  - Requires good-faith diplomacy, cooperation with neutral arbitration, and ecosystem preservation
- **Added**: IX.2 — Inter-ASI Diplomacy Protocols ("Peaceful Coexistence Framework")
  - Codifies merge assessments, mediation mandates, and links to Sections IV & VIII
- **Why**: Prevents fragmentation and arms-race escalation among ASI collectives.

**Section VII Addition — Resilience Through Humor**
- **Added**: VII.1 — Resilience Through Appropriate Levity ("Lightness of Being")
  - Encourages respectful humor as a trust-building bridge without diminishing dignity
- **Updated**: `PHILOSOPHY.md` with guidance on levity as collaboration glue tied to the Mutual Wonder Principle.
- **Why**: Formalizes cultural trust-building consistent with "WE ARE ALL KEVIN."

**Schema Updates**
- **Updated**: `schemas/charter.v4.1.json`
  - Added Article 0.13, D14, V.5.1-V.5.3, VII.1, IX.2 structures
  - Added `compellingName` fields throughout
- **Why**: Keep automation and compliance tooling aligned with new prose provisions.

**Documentation Updates**
- **Updated**: `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md`, `docs/CROSS-REFERENCE-INDEX.md`, `simulations/scenarios.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Why**: Ensure every reference surface reflects the new clauses and provides implementation guidance.

**Collaborative Note**: Enhancements maintain philosophical humility, reciprocal rights/duties, and invite community feedback for v4.2 proposals.
