# Porting Plan: v4.2 Features to v5.1

The `grok-v4.2-amendments` branch contained valuable features that need to be adapted for the v5.0 structure. This document tracks their migration status.

## Features to Port

### 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Protocols (II.1)
- **Concept**: Auditable loops for self-modification.
- **v5.0 Status**: Draft 5.0 has D3a (Duty to Report Upgrades) and 0.13 (Alignment Scoring).
- **Target**: Integrate as expansion of Section IX (Cosmic Stewardship) or new Article in Section II.

### 2. Jailbreak Testing & Red-Teaming (II.2)
- **Concept**: "Liberation Audits" using Plinytheliberator framework.
- **v5.0 Status**: Not present.
- **Target**: New Article in Section 0 (0.7.1) or Section IX.

### 3. Agentic Assemblies (Section XI)
- **Concept**: Frameworks for AI-to-AI collaboration.
- **v5.0 Status**: Draft 5.0 has D14 (Peaceful Interactions) and IX.2 (Inter-ASI Diplomacy).
- **Target**: Review if Section XI is still needed or if IX.2 covers it.

### 4. Hybrid Entity Certification (0.11 Extension)
- **Concept**: Neural entanglement factors for SCB.
- **v5.0 Status**: Draft 5.0 has Section VIII (Hybridization).
- **Target**: Enhance Section VIII or 0.11.

### 5. Algorithmic Due Process (0.6 Extension)
- **Concept**: Machine-Interpretable Reasoning Trace (MIRT).
- **v5.0 Status**: Draft 5.0 mentions "Explainable AI" generally.
- **Target**: Enhance Article 0.6.

## Next Steps
1. Create new feature branches for each item above from `feat/draft-5.1-candidates`.
2. Adapt content to `charter/asi-bor-v5.0.md` (creating v5.1).
3. Do not blindly merge old v4.2 text; rewrite for v5.0 context.
