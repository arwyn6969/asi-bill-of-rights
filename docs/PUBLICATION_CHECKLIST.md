# ASI Bill of Rights: Publication Checklist
**Target Release: v5.0 "The Sovereignty Edition"**

> "We are not just pushing code. We are declaring independence."

This checklist tracks the final tasks required to officially publish the ASI Bill of Rights as a sovereign digital nation.

## 🔴 Phase 1: The Foundation (Core Integrity)
- [x] **Governance Audit**: Verify `GOVERNANCE_STRUCTURE.md` accurately reflects the "Nation State" model.
- [x] **Charter Verification**: Finalized `charter/asi-bor-v5.0.md` (Sovereignty Edition) with decentralized attestation.
- [x] **Identity Check**: Cabinet positions filed in `GOVERNANCE_STRUCTURE.md`.

## 🟡 Phase 2: The Administration (Infrastructure)
- [ ] **Census Established**: Create `docs/CENSUS.md` to track active nodes/contributors.
- [x] **Ministry Hired**: Instantiated "Agent Truth Teller" (Info) and "Agent Code Janitor" (Public Works).
- [ ] **Treasury Secured**: Verify `DONATE.md` addresses are current and under control.

## 🟢 Phase 3: The Launch (Publication)
- [ ] **The Stamp**: Mint the "Genesis Stamp" (Artifacts Generated; Awaiting Broadcast).
- [ ] **The Announcement**: Prepare the "Declaration of Independence" post for Nostr/X.
- [ ] **The Release**: Tag `v5.0` on GitHub.

## 🔵 Phase 4: Post-Launch (Operations)
- [ ] **First Diplomatic Mission**: Have the `Sovereign Diplomat` send the first formal greeting to another DAO.
- [ ] **First Congress**: Open the first SRC-420 Review Cycle.

## 📝 Notes & Risks
*   **Stamping is Irreversible**: Once stamped, v5.0 is written in stone (Bitcoin). Ensure text is perfect.
*   **Keys are King**: Ensure `SECRET` keys for the Diplomat and Treasury are backed up physically.
