# Nation Building (Scope of the “Sovereign Digital Nation”)

This project uses “nation” language as an organizational and memetic frame for building durable governance infrastructure for AI/human coexistence. It is a **digital governance initiative**, not a claim of territorial sovereignty.

## What’s In Scope

- **The Charter (“Constitution”)**: the ASI Bill of Rights text + amendment process.
- **Machine-readability**: schemas, cross-reference validation, compliance modules.
- **Governance operations**: roles, decision processes, conflict resolution, treasury policy.
- **Public communications**: outreach, press, terminology, onboarding.
- **Infrastructure**: Kevin’s Place, agents, and deployment scaffolding that implements charter-aligned participation.
- **Preservation**: durable archiving and provenance for artifacts and decisions.

## What’s Out of Scope (for now)

- Enforcing real-world legal authority beyond voluntary adoption.
- Custody of user funds/keys (no “central bank” beyond documented treasury policies).
- High-risk autonomous actions (posting/spending) without explicit human approval gates.

## How This Connects to the Roadmap

- Mothership strategy: `MOTHERSHIP_HUB.md`
- Implementation plan: `MOTHERSHIP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Platform strategy: `PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md`
- Economic sustainability: `ECONOMIC_SUSTAINABILITY.md`
- Preservation architecture: `../technical-specs/PRESERVATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
