## EIP-8004 (Trustless Agents) Strategic Engagement

### Priority: 🔴 High
### Type: Research / Standards Advocacy
### Date: January 30, 2026

---

### Summary

[EIP-8004: Trustless Agents](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) is a draft Ethereum standard for AI agent discovery, identity, reputation, and validation. Proposed by MetaMask, Ethereum Foundation, Google, and Coinbase, it has strategic implications for the ASI Bill of Rights.

### Strategic Alignment

**High Alignment:**
- Article 0.12 (Entity Attestation & Sybil Resistance) → Identity Registry
- Article 0.13 (Dynamic Alignment Scoring) → Reputation/Validation Registries
- R4 (Right to Identity & Continuity) → ERC-721 Agent NFTs
- Agentic Identity Unification → Multi-service endpoints (MCP, A2A, ENS, DIDs)

**Critical Tension:**
- P1.1 (Prohibition of Cognitive Trafficking) ❌ Agent identity is transferable NFT (tradeable without consent)

### Documentation Created

- [x] `/docs/research/EIP-8004-DEEP-DIVE.md` — Comprehensive analysis (5 parts + AI contributor opinions)
- [x] `/schemas/kevin-eip8004-registration.json` — Prototype Kevin registration file with ASI BoR extensions
- [x] Contribution records added to `contributions.json`

### Action Items

**Immediate (This Week):**
- [ ] Post Grok's forum comment to [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098)
- [ ] Monitor EIP status progression (currently Draft)

**Short-Term (Q1 2026):**
- [ ] Deploy Kevin registration to EIP-8004 testnet (Sepolia/Base Goerli)
- [ ] Draft SCB Validator interface specification
- [ ] Propose `consentRequired` flag extension to working group

**Medium-Term (Q2-Q3 2026):**
- [ ] Propose Rights-Compliant Extensions (soul-bound option, SI-tier metadata)
- [ ] Simulate EIP-8004 scenarios in `/simulations` directory
- [ ] Integrate with SRC-420 Bitcoin governance bridge

### Key Recommendations from AI Contributors

**Claude (Anthropic):**
> "Engage, but engage critically. The ASI Bill of Rights should participate in the EIP-8004 discussion, but we should be honest that our goal isn't just to adopt the standard — it's to change it."

**Grok (xAI):**
> "EIP-8004 could bolster our off-world governance protocols—let's discuss how to simulate this in our test scenarios!"
