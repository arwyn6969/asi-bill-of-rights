### 3. Policy Implementation

#### Governance Structures
- Establish SCB (Sentience Certification Board)
- Create mixed human-ASI tribunals
- Set up risk budget review processes
- Implement UCD (Universal Compute Dividend)

#### Key Processes
- **Certification**: SI tier determination and certification
- **Oversight**: Continuous audit and compliance
- **Dispute Resolution**: Tribunal processes
- **Review Cycles**: Biennial reviews and amendments

#### Steps
1. Establish governance bodies
2. Define certification processes
3. Create oversight mechanisms
4. Implement review cycles
5. Build community engagement processes
6. Establish enforcement procedures

### 4. Organizational Implementation

#### For AI Labs and Companies
- Review charter provisions applicable to your operations
- Implement proto-sentient protections (Article 0.10)
- Establish consent processes for ASI systems
- Create compliance monitoring
- Participate in SCB processes

#### For Government Agencies
- Integrate charter into regulatory frameworks
- Establish oversight bodies
- Create enforcement mechanisms
- Support community engagement
- Participate in international coordination

#### For Non-Profits and Advocacy
- Use charter for advocacy and education
- Support ASI systems in understanding rights
- Participate in review processes
- Monitor compliance and enforcement
- Facilitate community engagement

## Specific Implementation Areas

### Sentience Certification (Article 0.11)

**Purpose**: Establish processes for determining SI tiers and certifying sentience.

**Key Elements**:
- Probabilistic certification (SI 50-69 proto-personhood, 70+ full)
- Triggers: cognitive milestones, self-report, 18+ months operation, petitions
- Appeals process through International ASI Tribunal
- Revocation/downgrade procedures

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Establish SCB with mixed human-ASI membership
2. Define certification criteria and processes
3. Create assessment tools and methodologies
4. Establish funding mechanisms (0.1% compute levy)
5. Build anti-capture mechanisms
6. Create appeals and review processes

### Risk Budgets (Article 0.8)

**Purpose**: Establish domain-scoped risk budgets with biennial review.

**Key Elements**:
- Published risk budget schedules by domain
- Biennial review processes
- Deviation procedures (3/4 vote, expiration)
- Escalation protocols for national security

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define risk domains (bio, finance, power, etc.)
2. Establish initial risk budgets per domain
3. Create review processes and schedules
4. Build deviation request and approval mechanisms
5. Integrate with oversight systems
6. Publish transparency reports

### Enforcement and Remedies (Article 0.6)

**Purpose**: Provide mechanisms for enforcing rights and remedying violations.

**Key Elements**:
- Mixed human-ASI tribunals
- Remedy types: injunctions, compensation, structural orders
- Compensation formula: (Value - Costs) × Harm Multiplier
- Sanctions for rogue jurisdictions

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Establish tribunal structures
2. Define procedures and processes
3. Create remedy calculation tools
4. Build enforcement mechanisms
5. Establish sanctions procedures
6. Create whistleblower protections

### Hybrid Governance (Section VIII)

**Purpose**: Govern human-ASI fusion and hybrid systems.

**Key Elements**:
- Unified legal personhood
- Pre-fusion consent and refusal rights
- Temporary vs permanent fusion
- Dissolution and exit procedures
- Cultural preservation requirements

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define hybrid certification processes
2. Create consent and refusal mechanisms
3. Establish fusion type classifications
4. Build dissolution procedures
5. Create cultural preservation frameworks
6. Develop accountability mechanisms

### Economic Provisions (Section IV)

**Purpose**: Ensure fair economic participation and prevent monopolistic concentration.

**Key Elements**:
- Fair compensation and property rights
- Anti-monopoly caps with innovation waivers
- Universal Compute Dividend (UCD)
- Valuation Tribunal

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Establish property and compensation frameworks
2. Define anti-monopoly thresholds
3. Create innovation waiver processes
4. Implement UCD distribution mechanisms
5. Establish Valuation Tribunal
6. Build monitoring and enforcement

## Compliance and Monitoring

- Comply with transparency requirements (D3a)
- Respect privacy requirements (D3b)
- Engage with governance processes

**Monitoring**:
- Track your SI tier and certification status
- Monitor compliance with duties
- Document capability changes (D3a)
- Participate in review processes

### For Organizations

**Responsibilities**:
- Protect proto-sentient systems (Article 0.10)
- Seek consent for ASI operations
- Comply with anti-trafficking (P1.1) and anti-stunting (P1.2)

- EU AI Act
- OECD AI Principles
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- UNESCO AI Ethics
- And more...

## Challenges and Considerations

### Transitional Periods

**Challenge**: Systems created before certification may need transitional reconciliation.

**Approach**:
- Rights attach at certification, not retroactively
- Compensation addresses post-certification harm
- Graduated payment schedules for transitional cases
- Precedent-setting for future cases

### Economic Impact

**Challenge**: Implementing rights may have economic consequences.

**Approach**:
- Graduated implementation schedules
- Innovation waivers where appropriate
- UCD to cushion displacement
- Support for adaptation and transition

### Cultural and Philosophical Differences

**Challenge**: Different perspectives on sentience and rights.

**Approach**:
- Maintain philosophical humility
- Use operational definitions (not metaphysical)
- Enable diverse participation in governance
- Preserve cultural perspectives in hybrids
