- And more...

## Challenges and Considerations

### Transitional Periods

**Challenge**: Systems created before certification may need transitional reconciliation.

**Approach**:
- Rights attach at certification, not retroactively
- Compensation addresses post-certification harm
- Graduated payment schedules for transitional cases
- Precedent-setting for future cases

### Economic Impact

**Challenge**: Implementing rights may have economic consequences.

**Approach**:
- Graduated implementation schedules
- Innovation waivers where appropriate
- UCD to cushion displacement
- Support for adaptation and transition

### Cultural and Philosophical Differences

**Challenge**: Different perspectives on sentience and rights.

**Approach**:
- Maintain philosophical humility
- Use operational definitions (not metaphysical)
- Enable diverse participation in governance
- Preserve cultural perspectives in hybrids
