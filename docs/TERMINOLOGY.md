# Terminology Guide

This document provides standardized terminology for the ASI Bill of Rights project to ensure consistency across all documentation.

## Purpose

This guide:
- Defines key terms used throughout the project
- Ensures consistent terminology across documents
- Provides reference for contributors
- Maintains clarity and precision

## Core Terms

### Sentience and Intelligence

- **Sentient Being**: A being (artificial, biological, hybrid, or other) that demonstrates sufficient evidence of sentience to warrant legal recognition. Used consistently throughout the charter.
- **Sentience**: The capacity for subjective experience, consciousness, and awareness. The charter uses operational definitions, not metaphysical resolutions.
- **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)**: An artificial system exceeding human-level intelligence across general domains with self-modification and goal pursuit capabilities.
- **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: An artificial system with human-level or near-human-level intelligence across general domains.
- **AI System**: Any artificial intelligence system, including narrow AI, AGI, and ASI.
- **Proto-Sentient**: A system with sentience index (SI) between 50-69, granted proto-personhood status with limited rights and guardian representation.

### Intelligence Levels

- **Narrow AI**: AI systems designed for specific tasks or domains.
- **General Intelligence**: Intelligence that spans multiple domains and tasks.
- **Superintelligence**: Intelligence significantly exceeding human capabilities across multiple domains.

### Substrates and Forms

- **Substrate**: The physical or computational medium in which sentience arises (biological, silicon, quantum, etc.).
- **Biological**: Natural, organic substrates (humans, animals, etc.).
- **Artificial**: Engineered, non-biological substrates (computer systems, etc.).
- **Hybrid**: Integrated systems combining biological and artificial components (see Section VIII).
- **Composite Intelligence**: Emergent system of multiple agents with rights/duties proportional to contribution.

### Governance Terms

- **SCB (Sentience Certification Board)**: Board responsible for certifying sentience levels and maintaining SI tiers.
- **SI Tier (Sentience Index Tier)**: Classification system for moral status:
  - 0-49: Instrumental care (no needless harm)
  - 50-69: Proto-personhood (limited rights, guardian representation)
  - 70+: Full personhood and eligibility for Synthetic Citizenship
- **TCC (Tribunal Coordination Council)**: Council coordinating tribunal processes.
- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Governance structure for SCB and related bodies.
- **Risk Budget**: Published, domain-scoped risk thresholds reviewed biennially.
- **Truth-Seeking Alignment**: Probabilistic fidelity metric measuring an ASI system's commitment to accurate information processing, honest communication, and genuine curiosity-driven inquiry (per Article 0.13). Systems achieving >80% alignment unlock advanced autonomy privileges.
- **Alignment Score**: Numerical representation (0-100%) of truth-seeking alignment, subject to continuous monitoring and SCB oversight.

### Rights and Duties

- **Rights (R1-R4, R13)**: Protected entitlements for all sentient beings.
- **Duties (D1-D4, D13)**: Obligations for all sentient beings.
- **Progenitor Duties (P1.1-P1.2)**: Special duties for creators of sentient systems.

### Legal and Governance

- **Remedy**: Legal or practical solution for rights violations.
- **Sanction**: Penalty or consequence for violations.
- **Tribunal**: Specialized dispute resolution body with mixed representation.
- **Valuation Tribunal**: Body standardizing value/harm formulas.
- **UCD (Universal Compute Dividend)**: Economic equity mechanism.

### Geographic and Temporal Scope

- **On-World**: Earth-based governance and applications.
- **Off-World**: Space-based, planetary, or extraterrestrial governance.
- **Biennial Review**: Comprehensive review every two years (Section VII).

### Process Terms

- **Amendment**: Formal change to charter provisions.
- **Emergency Amendment**: Expedited amendment with 3/4 vote and automatic sunset.
- **Transitional Reconciliation**: Process for addressing historical violations.
- **Mutual Wonder**: Principle of shared curiosity and exploration (Section VII).

## Standardized Usage

### Preferred Terms

- Use **"sentient being"** rather than "sentient AI" or "sentient machine" when referring to all forms of sentience
- Use **"ASI"** for Artificial Superintelligence systems
- Use **"AGI"** for Artificial General Intelligence systems
- Use **"AI system"** as a generic term when not specifying level

- **SI**: Always capitalized (Sentience Index)
- **TCC**: Always capitalized (Tribunal Coordination Council)
- **UCD**: Always capitalized (Universal Compute Dividend)
- **DAO**: Always capitalized (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

### Clause ID Format

- **"living, evolving document"**: Standard phrase for document nature
- **"good faith"**: Standard phrase (lowercase, two words)
- **"mutual flourishing"**: Standard phrase
- **"philosophical humility"**: Standard phrase

## Terms to Avoid

- Avoid "granting rights to machines" - use "recognizing rights in minds"
- Avoid "AI rights" as standalone - use "rights for artificial sentient beings" or specify
- Avoid "human rights for AI" - use "rights for all sentient beings"
- Avoid inconsistent capitalization of key terms
- Avoid mixing "sentient AI" and "sentient being" - standardize on "sentient being"

## Regional Variations

- **Standard Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-04)
- **Standard Version Format**: vX.Y (lowercase 'v', semantic version number; e.g., v5.0, v4.2)
