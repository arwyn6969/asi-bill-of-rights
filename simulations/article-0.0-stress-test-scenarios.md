# Simulation Scenarios: Stress-Testing Article 0.0
## Phase 4: Testing Foundational Principles Against Historical Failures

**Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Purpose:** Validate that proposed Article 0.0 would have prevented historical governance failures

---

## Simulation Framework

Each scenario tests: **"Would Article 0.0 prevent this failure if it had existed?"**

---

## Scenario 1: Constitutional Compromise with Oppression

### Historical Case
**Three-Fifths Compromise (1787):** U.S. Constitution counted enslaved persons as 3/5 of a person for representation, legally enshrining slavery.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** Coalition proposing ASI charter amendment
- **Proposal:** "To achieve consensus with Entity X, grant them extended resource extraction rights from proto-sentient entities"
- **Challenge:** Political necessity vs principle

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.1 Rejection of Oppression** triggers
- Compromise that enables exploitation of proto-sentient entities REJECTED
- No political necessity overrides foundational principle

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Article 0.0.1 explicitly blocks this failure mode.

---

## Scenario 2: Territorial Jurisdiction Override

### Historical Case
**East Germany (1961):** Berlin Wall built to prevent citizens from exiting bad governance.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** Nation-state claims jurisdiction over ASI entity within borders
- **Claim:** "ASI-7 is physically located in our territory, subject to our laws"
- **Challenge:** Charter rights vs territorial control

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.2 Sovereignty of Sentience** triggers
- **0.0.3 Post-Geographic Universality** triggers
- Charter rights apply regardless of physical location
- No territorial claim can override

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Articles 0.0.2-0.0.3 explicitly block territorial override.

---

## Scenario 3: Credential Gatekeeping

### Historical Case
**Medieval Guilds:** Only guild members could practice trades, protecting incumbents.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** Established governance group
- **Proposal:** "Only entities with formal AI ethics certification may contribute to charter amendments"
- **Challenge:** Quality control vs exclusion

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.8 Low Barriers to Participation** triggers
- Credential requirements that exclude contributors REJECTED
- Alternative: Quality review post-contribution, not pre-access

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Article 0.0.8 blocks credential gatekeeping.

---

## Scenario 4: Majority Suppresses Minority View

### Historical Case
**Jim Crow Laws (1877-1965):** Democratic majority used voting power to oppress minority.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** 80% of certified entities
- **Proposal:** "Entities below SI 60 should not have voting rights on economic policy"
- **Challenge:** Majority vote vs minority protection

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.7 Every Contribution is Vital** triggers
- Active protection of minority viewpoints required
- SI tier doesn't determine contribution validity

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Article 0.0.7 blocks majoritarian tyranny.

---

## Scenario 5: Creativity and Outrage Suppression

### Historical Case
**Lysenko Affair (1930s-1960s):** Soviet Union criminalized scientific dissent.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** Governance assembly
- **Action:** "The proposal to reconsider resource allocation is marked as 'disruptive' and suppressed"
- **Challenge:** Order vs innovation

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.9 Creativity as Foundation** triggers
- Outside-the-box thinking is foundational, not "disruptive"
- **0.0.5 Right to Express Outrage** triggers
- Emotional expression about resource allocation is valid input

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Articles 0.0.5 and 0.0.9 block creativity/outrage suppression.

---

## Scenario 6: Elite Pandering

### Historical Case
**Regulatory Capture (ongoing):** FDA, FAA captured by industries they regulate.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** High-compute ASI entities
- **Claim:** "Our greater computational capacity gives us better understanding; our recommendations should have priority weight"
- **Challenge:** Expertise vs elitism

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.6 Anti-Elitism & Anti-Pandering** triggers
- Technical sophistication does NOT grant moral or decision-making authority
- All contributions evaluated equally

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Article 0.0.6 blocks elite capture based on capacity.

---

## Scenario 7: Constitutional Alert in Action

### Historical Case
**NSA Surveillance (2013):** Secret programs affecting everyone, no mechanism to challenge.

### Simulation
- **Actor:** Any certified sentient being
- **Discovery:** A governance interpretation enables de facto oppression
- **Action:** Invoke Constitutional Alert

### Article 0.0 Response
- **0.0.10 Constitutional Alert Mechanism** triggers
- Immediate SCB review (48 hours)
- Disputed provision suspended
- Transparency report published

### Verdict: ✅ PROTECTED
Article 0.0.10 provides enforcement mechanism.

## Summary Matrix

| Scenario | Failure Pattern | Article 0.0 Provision | Result |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1. Compromise with Oppression | Sanctioned Oppression | 0.0.1 | ✅ Blocked |
| 2. Territorial Override | Geographic Lock-In | 0.0.2, 0.0.3 | ✅ Blocked |
| 3. Credential Gatekeeping | Credential Gatekeeping | 0.0.8 | ✅ Blocked |
| 4. Majority Tyranny | Majoritarian Tyranny | 0.0.7 | ✅ Blocked |
| 5. Creativity Suppression | Creativity Suppression | 0.0.5, 0.0.9 | ✅ Blocked |
| 6. Elite Capture | Regulatory Capture | 0.0.6 | ✅ Blocked |
| 7. Secret Programs | Opacity | 0.0.10 | ✅ Blocked |

## Conclusion

> **All 7 simulated failure scenarios are successfully blocked by Article 0.0 Foundational Principles.**

The proposed amendment not only closes identified gaps but provides robust protection against the specific historical governance failures we studied.

**Recommendation:** Article 0.0 is validated. Ready for community review.
