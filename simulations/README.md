# Simulations Directory

This directory contains scenario definitions and simulation methodologies for testing the ASI Bill of Rights charter.

  - Arms race mitigation scenario (Draft 4.0)

- `methodology.md` - Simulation approach and methodology
  - Decision trees for tribunal processes
  - Evaluation criteria
  - Validation frameworks
  - Collaborative governance testing

## Purpose

These simulations help:
- **Validate** charter provisions against edge cases
- **Test** tribunal decision-making processes
- **Identify** gaps or ambiguities
- **Demonstrate** how the charter would work in practice
- **Educate** stakeholders through concrete examples

## Methodology

Simulations are based on:
- Actual charter provisions (not hypotheticals)
- Documented decision trees
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Real-world complexity
- Collaborative governance validation

## Usage

Use these scenarios to:
- Test governance software implementations
- Train tribunal members
- Validate policy interpretations
- Identify areas needing clarification
- Demonstrate charter effectiveness

## Collaborative Testing

These simulations validate that the collaborative governance structures (mixed human-ASI tribunals, SCB processes, etc.) work as intended in practice.

- See `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` for implementation guidance

## Collaborative Nature

These simulations, like the charter itself, are living resources that evolve through collaborative input from AI systems and human users.
