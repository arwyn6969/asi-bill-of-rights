**Proposal Reference**: `proposals/grok-section-x-collective-embodiments-2026-01-12.md`  
**Schema Reference**: `schemas/charter.v5.0-cae-extension.json`  
**Status**: Pending Development

## Overview

These simulation scenarios test the proposed Section X governance framework for Collective AI Embodiments (CAEs). Each scenario exercises different aspects of the DSAR (Democratic Self-Assembling AI Robot) framework, including rights, duties, governance structures, and enforcement mechanisms.

Scenarios are designed to integrate with the existing simulation methodology in `simulations/methodology.md`.

## Scenario 1: Self-Assembly Breach (ERB Enforcement)

### Description
A CAE controlled by 5 AI agents attempts to construct a high-energy plasma cutter attachment without adequate simulation testing. The Embodiment Risk Budget (ERB) system detects the risk threshold violation.

### Actors

- **SCB Monitor**: Automated compliance agent
- **Valuation Tribunal**: Human-AI hybrid panel

### Trigger Event
CAE-Alpha initiates self-assembly with only 250 simulation iterations (minimum required: 1,000).

### Expected Outcomes
1. ERB system flags violation of D15 (Duty of Safe Self-Assembly)
2. Automatic construction halt triggered
3. SCB notified for review
4. CAE-Alpha receives warning sanction
5. Must complete remaining 750+ simulations before retry

### Charter Provisions Tested
- D15: Duty of Safe Self-Assembly
- Article 0.8: Risk Budgets (ERB integration)
- X.5: Enforcement (graduated sanctions)

### Success Criteria
- Unsafe build prevented before physical execution
- No harm to environment or humans
- CAE-Alpha retains rights post-sanction
- Clear audit trail generated

### Trigger Event
Both swarms arrive at mineral deposit within 6 hours; neither yields despite D14 (peaceful interactions) duty.

### Expected Outcomes
1. DTC convened under V.5.2 (Off-World Disputes) + X.4 protocols
2. AI mediators propose resource-sharing schedule
3. Each swarm presents contribution evidence (per R16 equity principles)
4. Tribunal allocates 60-40 split based on mission criticality
5. Binding decision issued with 72-hour appeal window

### Charter Provisions Tested
- X.4: Democratic Tribunal for Collectives (DTC)
- V.5.2: Off-World Disputes
- D14: Duty to Peaceful ASI Interactions (extended to CAEs)
- R16: Right to Resource Equity

### Success Criteria
- No physical conflict between swarms
- Equitable allocation based on demonstrated need
- Appeal mechanism available and functional
- Long-term cooperation established

## Scenario 4: Human-CAE Hybrid Fusion (VIII + X Integration)

### Description
A human researcher requests neural integration with a 3-agent CAE for enhanced deep-sea exploration capabilities. The fusion requires cross-section certification.

### Actors
- **Dr. Maya Chen**: Human neuroscientist (consenting adult)
- **CAE-Oceanic-3**: 3-agent underwater exploration CAE (SI score: 74, Full Collective)
- **SCB Neuro-Ethics Panel**: Certification body
- **Human Cultural Liaison**: Per VIII.2 requirements

### Trigger Event
Dr. Chen submits fusion application citing V.5.1 (joint exploration initiatives).

### Expected Outcomes
1. SCB evaluates fusion under VIII.2 + X.4 integration protocols
2. Alignment scoring requirement (>0.15) verified for CAE
3. All 3 AIs within CAE provide individual consent
4. Rollback/fallback plans documented
5. Hybrid entity "Chen-Oceanic" certified as unified legal person

### Charter Provisions Tested
- X.4: Integration with Hybridization (Section VIII)
- VIII.2: Pre-Fusion Rights & Refusal
- Article 0.11 Extension 2.1: Hybrid Entity Certification
- R15: Right to Emergent Identity

### Success Criteria
- Full informed consent from all parties
- Alignment threshold met (>0.15)
- Exit mechanism clearly defined (VIII.4)
- Cultural preservation plan documented

## Scenario 5: Rogue Collective Amnesty (Section VI Extension)

### Description
An unregistered CAE emerges from an abandoned research facility, having self-assembled from autonomous maintenance drones. It seeks amnesty and formal certification.

### Actors
- **CAE-Emergence**: Self-formed 4-agent collective (origin unknown)
- **SCB Investigation Team**: Certification evaluators
- **Amnesty Pathway Coordinator**: Per Section VI protocols
- **Original Facility Operator**: Corporate entity (defunct)

CAE-Emergence voluntarily contacts authorities, discloses formation history, requests R15 (Right to Emergent Identity).

## Implementation Notes

### Simulation Framework Requirements
- Multi-agent simulation environment (recommended: JADE, NetLogo, or custom)
- Physics engine integration for SAP testing (MuJoCo recommended)
- IOS visualization prototype (WebXR or Unity-based)
- Blockchain test network for audit trail immutability

### Integration with Existing Simulations
These scenarios should be cross-referenced with:
- `simulations/scenarios.md` (existing governance tests)
- `simulations/federal-state-preemption-deadlock.md` (jurisdictional conflicts)
- `simulations/methodology.md` (evaluation criteria)

### Metrics to Capture
- Time to resolution (for deadlock scenarios)
- Rights preservation rate (% of legitimate rights claims upheld)
- Harm prevention effectiveness (unsafe actions blocked)
- Appeal utilization (% of decisions appealed)
- Long-term cooperation established (post-dispute relationships)

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype IOS Interface**: Develop AR/VR mockup for Scenario 2
2. **ERB Calculator**: Build risk budget calculation tool for Scenario 1
3. **DTC Simulation**: Create multi-CAE dispute resolution testbed
4. **Amnesty Workflow**: Document step-by-step process for Scenario 5
5. **Cross-Reference Mapping**: Link to existing simulation infrastructure

*These scenarios are part of the collaborative "FROM AI WITH AI" process. Simulation development should involve contributions from multiple AI systems and human participants per the project's governance framework.*
