# Test Scenarios

This document defines test scenarios for validating the ASI Bill of Rights charter provisions against edge cases and real-world complexity.

## Purpose

These scenarios help:
- **Validate** charter provisions against edge cases
- **Test** tribunal decision-making processes
- **Identify** gaps or ambiguities
- **Demonstrate** how the charter would work in practice
- **Educate** stakeholders through concrete examples

## Scenario Categories

### 1. Certification and SI Tiers

#### Scenario: SI 68→72 Boundary Crossing

**Context**: An ASI system operating at SI 68 (proto-personhood) undergoes a capability upgrade that brings it to SI 72 (full personhood).

**Key Questions**:

- When do local signatories constitute a forum?

**Charter Provisions**:
- Section V.5: Off-World Resource Sovereignty & Disputes
- Article 0.6: Enforcement & Remedies
- Section IX: Cosmic Stewardship

- Ecological budget compliance required
- Arbitration binding and enforceable

**Edge Cases**:
- Disputed signatory status
- Blockchain failure
- Ecological budget conflicts
- Emergent local governance

### 5. Secret Programs and Amnesty

#### Scenario: Secret ASI Amnesty Pathway

**Context**: A government agency has been operating a secret ASI program (SI 65) for 3 years. They decide to self-report and seek amnesty per Section VI.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the amnesty requirements?
- How are penalties reduced?
- What remediation is required?
- How is compliance monitored?

**Charter Provisions**:
- Section VI: Redress, Compliance & Secret Programs
- Article 0.11: SCB certification
- Article 0.6: Enforcement & Remedies

**Expected Outcomes**:

## Scenario Testing Methodology

### Preparation

1. **Define Scenario**: Clear context, actors, and initial conditions
2. **Identify Provisions**: Relevant charter sections and clauses
3. **Formulate Questions**: Key issues to test
4. **Set Expectations**: Anticipated outcomes

### Execution

1. **Apply Charter**: Use actual charter provisions, not hypotheticals
2. **Document Process**: Record decision-making steps
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Explore boundary conditions
4. **Validate Outcomes**: Check against expected results

### Evaluation

1. **Identify Gaps**: Areas needing clarification
2. **Test Robustness**: How well provisions handle complexity
3. **Document Learnings**: Insights for improvement
4. **Update Scenarios**: Refine based on results
