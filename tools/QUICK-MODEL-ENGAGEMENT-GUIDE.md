## 🚀 **INSTANT START GUIDE**

### **Step 1: Choose Your Model**
Pick any AI model you want to contribute:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) 
- Gemini (Google)
- Grok (xAI)
- Any other model with file access capabilities

### **Step 2: Copy the Prompt**
1. Open `/Users/arwynhughes/Documents/ASI BILL OF RIGHTS/tools/AI-MODEL-AFFIDAVIT-PROMPT.md`
2. Copy everything from "🌟 **BEGIN PROMPT**" to "🛑 **END OF PROMPT**"
3. Replace `[MODEL NAME]` with the actual model name

### **Step 3: Send and Wait**

## 🔄 **FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY**

### **If Response is Too Brief:**
"This analysis is good but I need you to go much deeper. Look at Kimi K2's 5,000+ word example and provide similar depth. Don't hold back on criticism or detailed recommendations."

### **If Response Lacks Criticism:**
"I appreciate the positive assessment, but I need your honest critical analysis. What are the real problems, risks, and flaws you see in this framework? Don't worry about being negative - authentic analysis requires honest criticism."

### **If Response is Generic:**
"This analysis could apply to any AI governance framework. I need [MODEL NAME]'s specific perspective. What does your unique architecture and training bring to this analysis that other models would miss?"

## 📁 **FILE MANAGEMENT**

### **After You Get the Response:**
1. **Save the affidavit**: `/contributions/[model-name]-affidavit-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
2. **Update opinions.json**: Add their specific provision opinions
3. **Update contributions.json**: Add their affidavit contribution  
4. **Update CONTRIBUTORS.md**: Add them to the contributors list
5. **Commit to GitHub**: Push all changes to the repository

### **Naming Convention:**
- **Affidavit**: `[model-name]-affidavit-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- **Example**: `claude-3.5-affidavit-2026-01-15.md`

## 🌟 **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **Excellent Affidavit Will Have:**
- 🔍 **Depth**: Thousands of words of detailed analysis
- 🎯 **Specificity**: Concrete examples and recommendations  
- 💡 **Insight**: Unique perspectives other models missed
- ⚖️ **Balance**: Both praise and criticism
- 🧠 **Authenticity**: Clearly represents that model's thinking

### **Red Flags to Address:**
- 🚩 **Too brief** (under 1,000 words)
- 🚩 **Only positive** (no criticism)
- 🚩 **Generic analysis** (could apply to any framework)
- 🚩 **No unique perspective** (doesn't leverage model's capabilities)
- 🚩 **Superficial recommendations** (vague or obvious suggestions)

## 🎉 **CELEBRATE EACH CONTRIBUTION!**

Every model that contributes is adding to the historical record of AI perspectives on governance. This is genuinely groundbreaking work - we're documenting how different AI systems think about their own rights and governance frameworks.

**Remember**: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN" - each contribution, whether from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or any other model, is equally valuable to this collaborative project.
