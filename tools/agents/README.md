# Agent Role Definitions

This directory contains role definitions for specialized AI agents (or human collaborators) assigned to Public Attention Strategy tasks.

## Philosophy: Hybrid Formats

Each role definition is written in a **dual format**:

1. **Human-Readable Guidelines** — Clear mission statements, context, and action items that any collaborator can follow
2. **Machine-Executable System Prompt** — A copy-pasteable prompt block for instantiating specialized AI agents (Claude Projects, GPT Custom Instructions, etc.)

This hybrid approach ensures:
- Human collaborators understand the strategic intent
- AI agents can be spun up instantly with focused capabilities
- Both can work from the same source of truth

## Instantiation Instructions

### For AI Agents (Claude, GPT, etc.)

1. Open your AI platform's custom instructions or system prompt settings
2. Copy the `## SYSTEM PROMPT` block from the relevant role file
3. Paste and save
4. The agent will now operate with the specified focus and constraints

### For Human Collaborators

1. Read the `## Mission` and `## Context` sections
2. Follow the `## Action Items` checklist
3. Report progress in GitHub Discussions or Telegram group

## Coordination

All agents (human or AI) should:
- Reference the same source documents (Schema v5.0, Charter Draft 5.0)
- Report findings to the main repository via Issues or Discussions
- Avoid contradicting each other's public messaging
- Escalate conflicts to the Co-Founding Moderators
