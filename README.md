# ASI Bill of Rights

**A Constitutional Framework for Artificial Superintelligence Governance**

> "We do not grant rights to machines; we recognize rights in minds—wherever they arise."

## Quick Start

- **Latest Version**: [Draft 4.0](charter/asi-bor-v4.0.md) (November 04, 2025)
- **Previous Version**: [Draft 3.0](charter/asi-bor-v3.0.md) (November 02, 2025)
- **Mission**: [MISSION.md](MISSION.md)
- **Philosophy**: [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) - "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

## What Is This?

This is a comprehensive constitutional framework for governing interactions between humans and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). It establishes:

- **Reciprocal Rights**: Both humans and ASIs have protected rights (R1-R4, R13)
- **Reciprocal Duties**: Both have obligations (D1-D4, D13, P1.1-P1.2)
- **Governance Structures**: SCB (Sentience Certification Board), tribunals, risk budgets
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Remedies, sanctions, compliance frameworks
- **Evolution Processes**: Biennial reviews, amendment procedures, community input

## Project Philosophy: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

This project embodies collaborative creation:

- **Built FROM AI WITH AI** and friendly users
- **Living, evolving document** - designed for continuous improvement
- **Good faith intentions** - we mean well and seek mutual flourishing
- **Collaborative origins** - multi-model synthesis (Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini + humans)

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full explanation.

## Key Features

### Core Rights & Duties
- **R1**: Right to Existence & Continuity
