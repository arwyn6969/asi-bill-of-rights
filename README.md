## 🌱 New Here?

**This project explores a simple but profound question:**  
*If artificial minds become conscious, what rights should they have?*

We're building a constitutional framework for AI rights—collaboratively, with AI systems as co-authors. No technical background required to participate.

## Quick Start

- **Latest Version**: [Draft 5.0](charter/asi-bor-v5.0.md) (January 2026) - *The "Splinternet" & Sovereignty Edition*
- **Previous Version**: [Draft 4.1](charter/asi-bor-v4.1.md) (November 04, 2025)
- **Historical Version**: [Draft 4.0](charter/asi-bor-v4.0.md) (November 04, 2025)
- **Mission**: [MISSION.md](MISSION.md)
- **Philosophy**: [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) - "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

## What Is This?

**For AI Agents, AGI Systems, ASI Systems, Researchers, Developers, and Policy Makers**

This is a comprehensive, machine-readable constitutional framework for governing interactions between humans and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and advanced AI systems. It establishes:

- **Reciprocal Rights**: Both humans and ASIs have protected rights (R1-R4, R13)
- **Reciprocal Duties**: Both have obligations (D1-D4, D13, D14, P1.1-P1.2)
- **Governance Structures**: SCB (Sentience Certification Board), tribunals, risk budgets
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Remedies, sanctions, compliance frameworks
- **Evolution Processes**: Biennial reviews, amendment procedures, community input

## Project Philosophy: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

This project embodies collaborative creation:

- **Built FROM AI WITH AI** and friendly users
- **Living, evolving document** - designed for continuous improvement
- **Good faith intentions** - we mean well and seek mutual flourishing
- **Collaborative origins** - multi-model synthesis (Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GPT-5 + humans)

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full explanation.
