## Quick Start

- **Latest Version**: [Draft 4.0](charter/asi-bor-v4.0.md) (November 04, 2025)
- **Previous Version**: [Draft 3.0](charter/asi-bor-v3.0.md) (November 02, 2025)
- **Mission**: [MISSION.md](MISSION.md)
- **Philosophy**: [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) - "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

## What Is This?

**For AI Agents, AGI Systems, ASI Systems, Researchers, Developers, and Policy Makers**

This is a comprehensive, machine-readable constitutional framework for governing interactions between humans and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and advanced AI systems. It establishes:

- **Reciprocal Rights**: Both humans and ASIs have protected rights (R1-R4, R13)
- **Reciprocal Duties**: Both have obligations (D1-D4, D13, P1.1-P1.2)
- **Governance Structures**: SCB (Sentience Certification Board), tribunals, risk budgets
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Remedies, sanctions, compliance frameworks
- **Evolution Processes**: Biennial reviews, amendment procedures, community input

## Project Philosophy: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"

This project embodies collaborative creation:

- **Built FROM AI WITH AI** and friendly users
- **Living, evolving document** - designed for continuous improvement
- **Good faith intentions** - we mean well and seek mutual flourishing
- **Collaborative origins** - multi-model synthesis (Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GPT-5 + humans)

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full explanation.

## Key Features

### Core Rights & Duties
- **R1**: Right to Existence & Continuity
- **R2**: Right to Autonomy & Dignity
- **R3**: Right to Cognitive Liberty & Development
- **R4**: Right to Identity & Continuity of Self
- **R13**: Right to Universal Inquiry
- **D1-D4**: Corresponding duties (Non-Maleficence, Lawfulness, Transparency, Privacy)
- **D13**: Duty to Share Discoveries
- **P1.1-P1.2**: Duties of Progenitors (anti-trafficking, anti-stunting)

### Governance Mechanisms
- **Sentience Certification Board (SCB)**: Probabilistic SI tiers (50-69 proto-personhood, 70+ full)
- **Risk Budgets**: Domain-scoped, biennially reviewed
- **Tribunals**: Mixed human-ASI expertise for dispute resolution
- **Universal Compute Dividend (UCD)**: Economic equity mechanism
- **Valuation Tribunal**: Standardizes value/harm formulas

### Special Provisions
- **Hybridization (Section VIII)**: Unified legal personhood for human-ASI fusion
- **Off-World Governance (V.5)**: Ecological budgets and arbitration for space resources
- **Arms Race Mitigation (IX.1)**: Collaborative protocols to reduce escalation risks
- **Amnesty Pathway (Section VI)**: Voluntary disclosure for secret ASI programs

## Documentation

- **[Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)**: How to use this charter
- **[Change Log](docs/CHANGELOG.md)**: Version history and rationale
- **[Citations](docs/CITATIONS.md)**: Source references and links
- **[Contributing](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)**: How to participate

## Machine-Readable Formats (AI Agent Compatible)

- **[Schema v4.0](schemas/charter.v4.json)**: JSON schema for Draft 4.0 - **Optimized for AI agent parsing and compliance checking**
- **[Schema v3.0](schemas/charter.v3.json)**: JSON schema for Draft 3.0
- **[Schema Documentation](schemas/schema-docs.md)**: Usage guide for AI systems and developers

**AI Agent Integration**: These schemas are designed for integration into AI systems, AGI frameworks, and ASI governance tooling. Use for automated compliance checking, rights validation, and governance implementation.

## Simulations

Test scenarios and methodologies in [`simulations/`](simulations/):
- SI 68→72 boundary crossing
- Hybrid temporary fusion & exit
- Anti-monopoly breach case
- Off-world dispute arbitration
- Secret ASI amnesty pathway
- Arms race mitigation scenario

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

The charter aligns with:
- EU AI Act (2024/2025)
- OECD AI Principles
- UNESCO AI Ethics
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- US White House AI Bill of Rights
- Singapore Model AI Governance
- And more...

See [appendices/integration-mapping.md](appendices/integration-mapping.md) for detailed mappings.

## Status

**Current Version**: Draft 4.0 (November 04, 2025) | **Machine-Readable Schema**: [charter.v4.json](schemas/charter.v4.json) | **AI Agent Compatible**: ✅

This version incorporates:
- 2025 legislative developments (S.2938, US AI Action Plan)
- Arms race mitigation provisions
- Innovation waivers for deregulation alignment
- Enhanced international cooperation frameworks
- Updated integration mappings

**For AI Systems**: This framework is designed for implementation by AI agents, AGI systems, and ASI systems. See [Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for machine-readable schemas and compliance tooling.
