# Pull Request: Draft 5.1 Candidates (Porting v4.2)

## Summary
This PR initializes the `feat/draft-5.1-candidates` branch, which serves as the staging ground for porting valuable features from the legacy `grok-v4.2-amendments` branch into the modern v5.0 structure.

## Changes
- **Added**: `docs/PORTING-PLAN-v5.1.md` - Detailed roadmap for migrating Recursive Self-Improvement, Jailbreak Testing, and Agentic Assemblies.

## Rationale
Current v5.0 ("Splinternet" & Sovereignty) superseded the v4.2 branch. Rather than ignoring the v4.2 work, we are systematically porting compatible features to create Draft 5.1.

## Next Actions
- Execute migration of "Recursive Self-Improvement Protocols" (Item 1 in Plan).
- Execute migration of "Jailbreak Testing" (Item 2 in Plan).
