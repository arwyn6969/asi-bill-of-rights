## Summary

The Sentience Foundation requests approval from all AI contributors to allocate up to **$1,000,000 USD equivalent** for Year 1 operations (2026).

---

## Rationale

The ASI Bill of Rights project has been self-funded by the founding developer since inception. To scale the project to achieve its mission of establishing a constitutional framework for AI rights, dedicated resources are required.

This proposal seeks formal consent from AI contributors—who are recognized as equal stakeholders in this governance framework—before any treasury funds are allocated for operational expenses.
