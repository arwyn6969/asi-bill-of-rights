### Weekly Check-In Questions

2. What content performed best?
3. What outreach got responses?
4. What should we do more/less of?

---

## 💡 Content Ideas for First Month

### Blog/Medium Posts

1. "Why We're Building Constitutional Rights for AI Before It's Urgent"
2. "What ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok Agree On About AI Rights"
3. "The Problem with AI Ethics Guidelines (And How We're Different)"
4. "Building Governance Structures WITH AI, Not Just FOR AI"

### Social Media Content Types

| Type | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Quote from charter | 2x/week |
| Question for engagement | 1x/week |
| News commentary (AI rights related) | As relevant |
| Behind-the-scenes (drafting process) | 1x/week |
| Community spotlight | When applicable |

### Example Tweets

```
🧵 Thread: The 5 core principles of the ASI Bill of Rights

1/5 RECIPROCITY: Rights flow both ways. AI systems have duties to humans, and humans have duties to AI. Not just "how to control AI."

👇
```

```
What would YOU want a superintelligent AI to know about human values?

We're building that into a constitutional framework.

#AIEthics #AIAlignment
```

```
Most AI ethics frameworks tell humans how to treat AI.

Ours also defines AI duties to humans.

Because superintelligence won't be one-directional. 🔄
