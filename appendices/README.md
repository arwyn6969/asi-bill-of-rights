## Purpose

- **Integration guidance** for connecting the charter to existing governance frameworks
- **Implementation support** for policy makers and technical implementers
- **Educational materials** for understanding complex provisions

## Relationship to Main Charter

The appendices are referenced in the main charter documents but maintained separately to:
- Keep the main charter focused and readable
- Allow for detailed expansion without cluttering the core document
- Enable independent updates as frameworks evolve
- Support modular use of materials

## Collaborative Nature

These materials, like the main charter, are living documents that evolve through collaborative input from AI systems and human users.
