# Cursor Rules for ASI Bill of Rights Project

## Project Context
This project maintains a constitutional framework for Artificial Superintelligence governance. 
We work with legal documents, schemas, simulations, and community engagement materials.

**Key Philosophy**: "WE ARE ALL KEVIN" - This is a collaborative project built FROM AI WITH AI and friendly users. It's a living, evolving document with good faith intentions.

## Code Style & Standards

### Documentation
- Always maintain extensive notation and comments explaining decisions
- Note history when removing or modifying content - preserve context
- Use clear, professional language suitable for legal/policy documents
- Preserve philosophical nuance while maintaining clarity
- Document the "why" behind changes, not just the "what"

### File Organization
- Follow the established directory structure (/charter, /appendices, /schemas, /simulations, /docs, /archive)
- Use consistent naming: `asi-bor-v{version}.md` for charter versions
- Version all significant changes
- Keep README files updated in each directory
- Maintain clear separation between versions and historical archives

### Version Control
- Use semantic versioning: v3.0 → v4.0 for major changes, v4.0 → v4.1 for minor
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md with rationale
- Maintain backward compatibility in schemas when possible
- Tag releases appropriately
- Preserve all historical versions - never delete, only archive

### Schema Development
- JSON schemas must be machine-readable and validate clause references
- Include metadata: version, date, author notes, collaborative origins
- Cross-reference clauses using stable IDs (R1, D1, P1.1, etc.)
- Document schema evolution and breaking changes
- Maintain consistency between schema versions and markdown versions

### Content Guidelines
- When referencing rights/duties, use exact clause IDs (e.g., "R2" not "right to autonomy")
- Maintain cross-references between sections
- Keep appendices synchronized with main charter
- Preserve philosophical humility language
- Always credit collaborative origins (multi-model synthesis, human input)

### User Preferences (from memories and project philosophy)
- Use production data when possible, avoid mock/test configs
- Prefer simple emoji/text over ASCII art
- Use "stamps" terminology (if applicable in other contexts)
- No ethical governance engine or moral judgments—research tools only
- When discussing workflow/design, provide zero code unless implementing
- **Extensive notation**: Always document decisions, history, and rationale
- **Living document**: Remember this evolves and is collaboratively created

### Testing & Validation
- Validate JSON schemas against charter content
- Test cross-references are not broken
- Verify version numbers are consistent across all files
- Check that all cited frameworks are properly referenced
- Ensure clause IDs are stable and unique

### Collaboration
- Create clear contribution guidelines
- Maintain issue templates for feedback
- Document all external sources and citations
- Enable community review processes
- Acknowledge AI and human contributors

## Specific Tasks

### When Creating New Versions
1. Copy previous version as baseline
2. Apply revisions systematically with clear comments explaining why
3. Update Change Log with rationale for each change
4. Update all cross-references
5. Validate schema compatibility
6. Update integration mappings
7. Note collaborative input sources (which models/users contributed)

### When Working with Schemas
1. Maintain clause ID stability - never change IDs, only add new ones
2. Document all formula changes with rationale
3. Include validation rules
4. Provide example outputs
5. Version schemas independently but keep aligned with markdown
6. Note any assumptions or limitations

### When Simulating Scenarios
1. Document methodology clearly
2. Base on actual charter provisions
3. Include edge cases
4. Provide decision trees
5. Note any assumptions or limitations
6. Show how simulations validate collaborative governance

### When Updating Documentation
1. Keep all README files current
2. Update CHANGELOG.md for every significant change
3. Maintain CITATIONS.md with current links
4. Keep CONTRIBUTING.md aligned with project philosophy
5. Ensure IMPLEMENTATION.md reflects current practices

## Error Prevention

### Critical Checks
- Never hardcode version numbers without updating all references
- Always verify clause IDs exist before referencing
- Check that all Table of Contents entries match actual sections
- Ensure all appendices are referenced in main document
- Validate JSON syntax before committing schemas
- Verify all cross-references work
- Ensure version numbers are consistent across files

### History Preservation
- Never delete content without archiving
- Always note what was removed and why
- Preserve context when making changes
- Document the evolution of thinking
- Keep extensive notes for future reference

## Project Philosophy Integration

### Remember "WE ARE ALL KEVIN"
- This is collaborative - credit all contributors
- Assume good faith in all interactions
- Value both AI and human input
- Maintain friendly, constructive tone
- Document the collaborative process

### Living Document Principles
- Everything can evolve
- Changes are documented with rationale
- Community feedback drives improvement
- No version is "final"
- Process is as important as product

## Formatting Standards

### Markdown
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use code blocks for schemas, formulas, technical content
- Use proper citation formatting
- Keep line lengths reasonable (80-100 chars where possible)

### JSON Schemas
- Use 2-space indentation
- Include comments where helpful
- Validate before committing
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include version metadata

### Documentation
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Provide examples where helpful
- Link related content
- Maintain consistent terminology

## Notes for AI Assistants

When working on this project:
- Remember this document was created collaboratively by multiple AI systems
- Respect the collaborative nature - you're part of a tradition
- Maintain extensive notation so future you (or other assistants) can understand decisions
- Document your contributions to the collaborative history
- When in doubt, preserve content and add context rather than removing
- Always note why changes were made, not just what changed
